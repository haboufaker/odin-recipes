    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasticho is a delicious version of lasagna that is very popular in Venezuela. Its origins come from the Mediterranean, where a similar dish called pastitsio is made with tubular pasta and lots of creamy béchamel sauce. In Venezuela, pasticho is prepared with regular lasagna noodles layered alternately with a tomato-based meat sauce and béchamel sauce, with cheese and sometimes ham interspersed within the layers. It requires an extra cooking step, but it's well worth it.</p>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mushroom Sauce</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2-1/4 cups sliced baby portobello mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cups shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook the beef, pork, onion, celery and carrot in oil over medium heat until meat is no longer pink. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Drain. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato puree, bay leaf and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, saute mushrooms in butter and oil until tender. Add the cream, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Stir in Parmesan cheese; cook and stir for 20-25 minutes or until thickened.</li>
        <li>Discard bay leaf from meat sauce. Spread 1-1/4 cups meat sauce into a greased 4-qt. baking dish. Top with six noodles. Layer with 1-3/4 cups meat sauce, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, six noodles, 1-1/4 cups mushroom sauce, 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers three times. Top with remaining noodles, meat sauce, mushroom sauce, mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese (dish will be full).</li>
        <li>Cover and bake at 400° for 20 minutes. Uncover; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until golden brown and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
